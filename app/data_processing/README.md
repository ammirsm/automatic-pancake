#Preprocessing:
In this function we will use some preprocessing tools in NLP to clean the data and make it ready for active learning process.

##Usage
###How to preprocess data
```
$ python main.py /path/to/your/dataset.ris /path/to/your/pdf/dir/ /path/to/your/output/dir/
```
Note: While we're doing the preprocessing we're saving some assets in the `asset` directory which you can use and not reading the PDFs in the main function later.
