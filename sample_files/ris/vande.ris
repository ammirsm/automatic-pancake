AB  - Social workers at The Alfred, a major tertiary referral teaching hospital in Melbourne, Australia, played a key role in providing psychosocial support to patients and their families following the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires in the State of Victoria. Faced with the highest number of casualties ever admitted simultaneously, and the media and community involvement surrounding the national disaster, new practice challenges emerged that led to tensions when compared to everyday practice. This article examines three challenges identified in the team's critical reflections-managing privacy and publicity; negotiating the boundaries of professional practice; and managing the impact of the work. These practice challenges are considered in light of relevant trauma and disaster literature that addresses the importance of promoting self-efficacy, hope, and connectedness; forming collective narratives of survivorship and resilience; negotiating the ethical questions of service intimacy and intensity; and implementing both active and avoidant self-care strategies. These challenges are relevant to disaster work that social workers and other health professionals will respond to in the future, and therefore they can inform disaster planning responses. © 2013 © 2013 Australian Association of Social Workers.

AB  - Clinical brain profiling is an attempt to map a descriptive nosology in psychiatry to underlying constructs in neurobiology and brain dynamics. This paper briefly reviews the motivation behind clinical brain profiling (CBP) and presents some provisional validation using clinical assessments and meta-analyses of neuroscientific publications.The paper has four sections. In the first, we review the nature and motivation for clinical brain profiling. This involves a description of the key aspects of functional anatomy that can lead to psychopathology. These features constitute the dimensions or categories for a profile of brain disorders based upon pathophysiology. The second section describes a mapping or translation matrix that maps from symptoms and signs, of a descriptive sort, to the CBP dimensions that provide a more mechanistic explanation. We will describe how this mapping engenders archetypal diagnoses, referring readers to tables and figures. The third section addresses the construct validity of clinical brain profiling by establishing correlations between profiles based on clinical ratings of symptoms and signs under classical diagnostic categories with the corresponding profiles generated automatically using archetypal diagnoses. We then provide further validation by performing a cluster analysis on the symptoms and signs and showing how they correspond to the equivalent brain profiles based upon clinical and automatic diagnosis.In the fourth section, we address the construct validity of clinical brain profiling by looking for associations between pathophysiological mechanisms (such as connectivity and plasticity) and nosological diagnoses (such as schizophrenia and depression). Based upon the mechanistic perspective offered in the first section, we test some particular hypotheses about double dissociations using a meta-analysis of PubMed searches. The final section concludes with perspectives for the future and outstanding validation issues for clinical brain profiling.

AB  - Reports an error in "Confirmatory factor analysis of the posttraumatic stress disorder checklist" by Marni A. Gauci and Douglas A. MacDonald (Journal of Aggression, Maltreatment & Trauma, 2012[Apr], Vol 21[3], 321-330). In the original article, the authors wish to point out that the RMSEA value in Table 1 for the 2-factor Model was listed incorrectly as .01. It should have been listed as .10. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2012-10160-005). Several studies have employed confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to examine the latent structure of the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist (PCL; Weathers, Litz, Herman, Huska, & Keane, 1993), a measure that assesses PTSD symptomatology. Findings have failed to support the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text revision [DSM-IV-TR]; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) PTSD model, consisting of reexperiencing, avoidance/numbing, and arousal factors, and no consensus has emerged regarding the best fitting alternative model. Additionally, most studies have utilized homogeneous trauma samples. This study used CFA to examine the PCL factor structure in a sample with exposure to various traumatic events. Superior fit was demonstrated by a model specifying reexperiencing, avoidance, dysphoria, and arousal factors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Carlson (Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy, Advanced Online Publication, May 14, 2012, np). There was an error in the section, "Models 5 and 5a: The Component and Subtype Models." The paragraph that began, "Taxometric studies of dissociation in PTSD are also relevant to the Subtype model . . ." has been replaced with a paragraph that begins, "One taxometric study of dissociation in PTSD is also relevant to the Subtype model . . ." (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2012-12663-001.) The purpose of this article is to examine how closely six theoretical models fit the empirical evidence reviewed in Part 1 on the relationship between trauma and dissociation and to apply the resulting conclusions to make recommendations about diagnostic criteria for PTSD. We describe six models for the relationships among traumatic stress, dissociation, and PTSD, including models for fantasy-proneness, mediation, comorbidity, interactional comorbidity, component, and subtype. The research reviewed strongly supports component and subtype models of the relationship between dissociation and PTSD, and recommendations are made for including dissociative symptoms in the diagnostic criteria for PTSD in ICD-11 and DSM-5 and adding either a dissociative subtype or a complex PTSD diagnosis in both diagnostic systems.

Poisson, L.R. Schultz and V.C. Lucia (Psychological Medicine, 2004[Jul], Vol 34[5], 889-898). There was an error in the first sentence of the 'Data analysis' section on page 891. The correct version of the sentence is present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2004-17343-013). Community surveys have assessed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in relation to traumatic events designated by respondents as the worst they have ever experienced. An assessment of PTSD in relation to all reported traumas would impose too great a burden on respondents, a considerable proportion of whom report multiple traumas. The 'worst event' method is efficient for identifying persons with PTSD, but may overestimate the conditional probability of PTSD associated with the entire range of PTSD-level traumas. In this report, we evaluate this potential bias. The Detroit Area Survey of Trauma (n = 2181) estimated the PTSD risk from two samples of traumas: (1) a representative sample of traumas formed by selecting a random trauma from each respondent's list of traumas; and (2) traumas designated by respondents as the worst (the standard method). Results showed that both estimation methods converged on key findings, including identifying trauma types with the highest probability of PTSD and sex differences in the risk of PTSD. Compared to the random events, the 'worst event' method yielded a moderately higher conditional probability for PTSD (0.136 v. 0.092). The bias was due almost entirely to the deviation of the distribution of the worst events from expected values, if all event types had equal prior selection probabilities. Direct adjustment, setting the distribution equal to expected values and applying the observed probabilities of PTSD associated with individual event types brought the estimate close to the unbiased estimate, based on the randomly selected traumas. Only the 'worst event' method can be used as a short-cut to assessing all traumas. The bias in the estimated risk of PTSD is modest and is attenuated by direct adjustment.

In figure 1 of this Article, a box describing the number of full-text papers considered for inclusion has been added, and the numbers in the list of exclusions have been corrected. In the text, the number of full-text papers considered for inclusion has been corrected. These corrections have been made to the online version. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2015-57589-028). Background: An increasing number of studies have investigated the pharmacological prevention of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and acute stress disorder (ASD). This is the first systematic review to examine the effects of pharmacotherapies (eg, beta blockers, hydrocortisone, and selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors) given within the first month after a traumatic or aversive event to prevent PTSD or ASD compared with no pharmacotherapy or placebo control. Methods: A systematic literature search in PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane database of randomised trials was done. Studies included randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, and cohort studies; their overall quality was low to moderate. We computed the pooled incidence risk ratio (IRR): the risk of incidence of PTSD or ASD in the pharmacotherapy groups relative to the incidence of PTSD or ASD in the control groups. Additionally, we computed Hedges'g effect sizes for PTSD or ASD continuous outcomes. Findings: 15 studies met inclusion criteria (1765 individuals). Pharmacotherapy was more effective in preventing PTSD or ASD than placebo or no intervention (14 studies, 1705 individuals, IRR 0.65, 95% CI 0.55-0.78; number needed to treat 11.36), although no effect was found when only randomised controlled trials were included (ten studies, 300 individuals, IRR 0.69, 95% CI 0.40-1.21). Hydrocortisone showed a large effect in reducing the risk of PTSD (five studies, 164 individuals, IRR 0.38, 95% CI 0.16-0.92). Interpretation: No firm evidence was found for the efficacy of all early pharmacotherapies in the prevention of PTSD or ASD, but hydrocortisone reduced the risk of developing PTSD. The small number of studies and their limited methodological quality cast uncertainty about the effects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

Andrew, Cecil M. Burchfiel and John M. Violanti (Stress and Health: Journal of the International Society for the Investigation of Stress, 2014[Dec], Vol 30[5], 405-415). In the original article, there are errors in Table 1 and the corresponding text describing the Table (p. 409). The corrected Table and text appears in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2014-54647-008). Following Hurricane Katrina, police officers in the New Orleans geographic area faced a number of challenges. This cross-sectional study examined the association between resilience, satisfaction with life, gratitude, posttraumatic growth, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder in 84 male and 30 female police officers from Louisiana. Protective factors were measured using the Connor-Davidson Resilience scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale, the Gratitude Questionnaire, and the Posttraumatic Growth inventory. Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder were measured using the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian (PCL-C). Potential associations were measured using linear regression and analysis of variance. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race, education, and alcohol. Mean PCL-C symptoms were 29.5 +/- 14.5 for females and 27.8 +/- 12.1 for males. Adjusted mean levels of PCL-C symptoms significantly decreased as quartiles of resilience (p < .001), satisfaction with life (p < .001), and gratitude (p < .001) increased. In contrast, PCL-C symptoms were not associated with posttraumatic growth in this sample. These results indicate that positive factors such as resilience, satisfaction with life, and gratitude may help mitigate symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. To further explore these relationships, longitudinal follow-up in a larger population would be of interest. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)

PTSD's defined clinical syndrome might best be conceptualised as encompassing a broad range of reactions to adverse events that are in turn influenced by multiple dimensionally distributed factors. For the moment, it appears that the very literature spurred by the creation of PTSD has demonstrated, somewhat ironically, that the construct is flawed. It is in the context of these concerns that we acknowledge issues raised in the commentaries and encourage continued discussion on the validity of the PTSD diagnosis.

The purpose of this study is twofold: 1) to develop a posttraumatic stress reaction screening instrument, 2} to assess the posttraumatic stress disorder through the Sefa Bulut Children-Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Screening Survey (SBC-PTSDSS) in order to examine the effectiveness of the survey. The participants of this study were 4th and 5th grade elementary school children who have been exposed to the tornado in Oklahoma, the United States and children who experienced the earthquakes in Turkey. Data were collected from severely hit and moderately hit areas of the two countries 11 months later after the tornado and earthquakes through the same scale. Frequency and Percentages were calculated as item analysis. In addition, data were analyzed with a one-way ANOVA. Tukey pair-wise comparisons revealed a significant difference between Turkish and American children F (1-264)=24.41, P(.01) but not between the high and low impact groups within each setting (M=18.14, M=19.14 vs. M=8.63, M=9.25).

A minor typographic error in the article title occurred in the html-text and -title. Furthermore, the name of one of the co-authors was misspelled: the fourth author's name is "Berit Tarnell". The online version of the original article can be found at: http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00406-005-0559-9. (The following abstract of this article originally appeared in record 2005-14658-010.) Objective: Psychological trauma leads to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in susceptible subjects.The aim of this study was to investigate the differences in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) between two groups of subjects exposed to different types of traumatic stressor either developing or not developing PTSD. Method: Twenty subjects developing (S) and 27 not developing (NS) PTSD after being exposed to either earlier person-under-the-train accident (NA) or being assaulted in the underground environment (A) were included in the study. 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT was performed and the uptake in 29 regions of the brain (VOIs), bilaterally, was assessed. rCBF distribution was compared, using analysis of variance (ANOVA), between groups (S/NS) and type (A/NA) during a situation involving an auditory evoked re-experiencing of the traumatic event. Discriminant analysis was applied to test the concordance between clinical diagnosis and SPECT findings. Results: In the general analyses significant differences were found between groups and types and there was a significant hemisphere x type interaction. S showed higher CBF than NS and so did A as compared to NA, particularly in the right hemisphere. Discriminant analysis correctly classified 66% of cases (p<0001) in testing S/NS and 72% (p<0001) in testing NA/A. Conclusions: Under recall of their traumatic experience we found higher relative CBF distribution values in S as compared to NS. CBF was higher in the right hemisphere and particularly in assaulted subjects. These findings underscore the role upon trauma recall of both the right hemisphere and the nature of the stressing event. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

When this manuscript was first submitted to JPP, analyses were run in the AMOS software. However, in the revision, Mplus software was used instead in order to be able to adjust to dependency in data. Owing to Mplus handling missing data differently than AMOS, the dataset used in the final analyses was corrupted and based on the wrong number of participants. The authors regret this mistake. They have rerun the analyses in Mplus with a correct dataset and some corrections were made. The corrections are present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2012-10988-009). Objectives: To determine the factor structure of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and assess its stability over time among parents of children diagnosed with cancer. Methods: Parents of children with cancer included in a longitudinal study completed the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Checklist-Civilian Version 2 weeks (n = 249) and 2 (n = 234) and 4 (n = 203) months after their child's diagnosis. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to assess 3 models of the underlying dimensions of PTSD and invariance tests were used to assess stability over time. Results: A longitudinal CFA with the factors reexperiencing, avoidance, dysphoria, and hyperarousal provided best fit to the data. Invariance testing suggested that the pattern and size of loadings were equivalent across the three assessments. Discussions: Findings tentatively suggest that PTSS among parents of children with cancer consist of four factors. Implications for research and clinical practice are discussed.

Brennan (Psychological Medicine, 2014[Jan], Vol 44[1], 161-172). In the original article, there were errors in Figure 1. The correct Figure 1 is present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2013-44252-015). Background: Numerous studies have supported an association between maternal depression and child psychiatric outcomes, but few have controlled for the confounding effects of both maternal and offspring co-morbidity. Thus, it remains unclear whether the correspondence between maternal and offspring depressive and anxiety disorders is better explained by associations between shared features of maternal and offspring internalizing disorders or by specific effects exerted by unique aspects of individual disorders. Method: Pairs of mothers and offspring overselected for maternal depression (n = 815) were assessed at offspring age 15 years for anxiety and depressive disorders; 705 completed a follow-up at offspring age 20 years. For both mothers and offspring, structural equation modeling was used to distinguish transdiagnostic internalizing pathology - representing the overlap among all depressive and anxiety disorders - from diagnosis-specific forms of pathology. To discriminate between general versus specific pathways of intergenerational transmission of psychopathology, we examined (a) the general association between the maternal and offspring internalizing factors and (b) the correlations between maternal and offspring diagnosis-specific pathology for each disorder. Results: For mothers and offspring, a unidimensional latent variable model provided the best fit to the correlations among depressive and anxiety disorders. The maternal transdiagnostic internalizing factor strongly predicted the corresponding factor among offspring. In addition, the unique component of post-traumatic stress disorder among offspring was significantly related to the analogous unique component among mothers, but specific components of other maternal disorders, including depression, did not predict corresponding offspring pathology. Conclusions: Results suggest that intergenerational transmission of internalizing disorders is largely non-specific. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is over represented in the prisoner population and is predictive of violence and suicide. This raises issues in relation to prisoner management, as well as theoretical issues such as why there is a range of vulnerability for PTSD. The current study examines the relationship between PTSD and personality profiles of prisoners. Method: Data from 1305 participants in the NSW survey of health in prisoners are examined to identify relationships between personality profiles derived from the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) and PTSD. Participants are grouped as experiencing no trauma; with a trauma history but no PTSD; and being diagnosed with PTSD. A logistic regression modelled significant predictors of PTSD. These data indicated that women prisoners report PTSD at twice the rate of males. An increased risk for PTSD is associated with high Harm Avoidance, low Self-Directedness, high Persistence and high Self-Transcendence. Conclusions: A combination of both temperament and character traits influences the trajectory towards PTSD development. Targeted treatment of these traits is needed in addressing the problems of prisoners with PTSD and managing the associated risks of violence and suicide. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Records of the war service disability claims for Australian Vietnam veterans in Tasmania (n = 751) were analysed to establish patterns of interrelationships between categories of disability. The predicted relationship between psychiatric disability and stress related skin disabilities was strongly supported and relationships between psychiatric and other medical disabilities were found. An exploratory principal components analysis produced three independent components which accounted for 21.2 percent of total variance. Component 1 was interpreted as a general military service component and components 2 and 3 were labelled as stress components. The most likely interpretation of the two stress components was that they reflect differences in profiles of records for disability claims depending on the time when the disability presented. The relevance of the findings is discussed.

AB  - Availability of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors containing (beta)2 subunits ((beta)2-nAChRs) was studied in unmedicated, symptomatic patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and healthy control subjects, all current non-smokers. A subgroup of participants had a history of smoking. Availability of (beta)2-nAChRs in the mesiotemporal cortex, prefrontal cortex, thalamus and striatum was determined using the radiotracer [123I]5-IA-85380 ([123I]5-IA) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). PTSD symptoms were assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). Never-smoking PTSD patients compared to never-smoking healthy controls showed significantly higher [ 123I]5-IA binding in the mesiotemporal cortex (ANOVA: F=6.21, d.f.=1, 11, p=0.030). Among all PTSD patients, there was a significant correlation between the re-experiencing symptom cluster and thalamic [123I]5-IA binding (R2=0.66, p=0.019, Bonferroni corrected). These findings not only suggest an involvement of (beta)2-nAChRs in the pathophysiology of PTSD but also raise the possibility that this receptor may be a novel molecular target for drug development.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The World Trade Centre Health Registry (WTCHR) prospectively follows a cohort of over 71 000 individuals who reported being directly exposed to the 9/11/01 terrorist attack. Among police registrants at Survey Wave 2, 5-6 years after 9/11/01, four unique trajectories of probable PTSD symptoms were identified: resilient (83%), recovered (2.5%), delayed onset (11.2%) and chronic (5.3%). The current study documents the longitudinal trajectories of PTSD in police officers exposed to the WTC attacks at Wave 3 (2011-2012), over 10 years since the WTC attack. METHOD: We examined the prevalence of probable PTSD at the Wave 3 survey using a cut-off score of 44 or greater on the event-specific Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL) and at least one re-experiencing symptom (DSM-IV criterion B), three avoidance or numbing symptoms (DSM-IV criterion C), and two hyperarousal symptoms (DSM-IV criterion D). RESULTS: Probable PTSD was 14.4% (95% CI 13.0-15.9%) at Wave 2 and 12.9% (95% CI, 11.6-14.3%) at Wave 3. Significant predictors of chronic probable PTSD 10 years post-disaster (n = 59/2241, 2.6%) include age 45-69 (aOR 3.16, 95% CI, 1.7-6.0), number of stressful events witnessed on 9/11/01 (aOR 3.00, 1.6-5.8), five or more stressful life events since 9/11/01 (aOR 5.42, 1.9-15.2), and unmet mental health care needs (aOR 6.86, 3.3-14.1). Protective factors include social support (aOR 0.34, 0.1-0.97) and number of close friends or relatives (aOR 0.92, 0.87-0.98). CONCLUSIONS: Chronic probable PTSD among police responders continues to be a significant problem, associated both with intervening stressful life events and unmet mental health care needs.

AB  - Butachlor, one of the most widely used herbicides in agriculture, has been reported with high ecotoxicity to aquatic plants and animals. In this study, a 1H NMR based metabolomics approach combined with histopathological examination and biochemical assays was applied to comprehensively investigate the toxic effects of butachlor on four important organs (gill, brain, liver and kidney) of goldfish (Carassius auratus) for the first time. After 10 days' butachlor exposure at two dosages of 3.2 and 0.64μmol/L, fish tissues (gill, brain, liver and kidney) and serum were collected. Histopathological inspection revealed severe impairment of gill filaments and obvious cellular edema in livers and kidneys. The increase of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in gill and methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) level in four tissues reflected the disturbance of antioxidative system in the intoxicated goldfish. Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and creatinine (CRE) level were increased in butachlor exposure groups, suggesting liver and kidney injuries induced by butachlor. Orthogonal signal correction partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OSC-PLS-DA) of NMR profiles disclosed metabolic changes that were related to the toxic effects of butachlor including oxidative stress, disorder of energy metabolism and amino acids metabolism, and disturbance of neurotransmitter balance in butachlor exposed goldfish. This integrated metabolomics approach provided a molecular basis underlying the toxicity of butachlor and demonstrated that metabolomics was a powerful and highly effective approach to elucidate the toxicity and underlying mechanisms of herbicides and pesticides, applicable for their risk assessment.

AB  - Introduction : Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist that has been a well-known anesthetic agent for many years. In small doses it also has analgesic effects while having minimal effects on respiration and hemodynamics, making it a useful adjunct in the treatment of patients in ICU settings. For the last 25 years at the Norris Cancer Hospital ICU, we have used ketamine in the vast majority of our cases, consisting mainly of urologic patients as well as general surgery and gynecology-oncology patients. We attribute to ketamine our improved outcome relating to pain relief, early extubation, and stable hemodynamics, which results in decreased morbidity. Methods : We retrospectively studied data from the Urology department data bank and the hospital pharmacy for the use of ketamine. 85% of the patients had undergone extensive urologic resections including radical cystectomy, pelvic exenteration, radical nephrectomies, and radical retroperitoneal lymph node dissections; other procedures included Whipple, hepatectomy, abdominoperineal resection, and major gynecological cancer procedures. A combination infusion of ketamine (500 mg) and fentanyl (1250 mcg) in 250cc normal saline was used in patients that were extubated. Initially, patients received 2-4 mg of intravenous morphine before the mixture began to take effect. In cases of ventilated patients midazolam (25 mg) was added to the combination. Clinical parameters of pain and sedation were evaluated by the ICU resident and nurses and the infusions were titrated accordingly. Results : Most surgical patients were extubated on an average of 1-2 days postoperatively. The average dose requirement was 3-7cc/ hr, ranging from 2cc/hr to 10cc/hr, titrated to pain relief. No changes in hemodynamics were noted with the dose range and combination; there was no incidence of hypotension or tachycardia. Respirations were unaffected. Analgesia was observed to be superior to each of the drugs on its own, indicating a synergistic rather than additive effect. Less than 1% of patients complained of visual dreams, slightly lower than those receiving only morphine. There were no cases of prolonged ileus attributable to the combination. There was a very low incidence of depression, both immediate and delayed, and the incidence of PTSD and anxiety states were negligible. Discussion : Ketamine has many beneficial effects in addition to analgesia and amnesia. It is a bronchodilator and has minimal effects on respiration, making it easier to wean patients off respirators. Its cholinergic agonist properties have a positive effect on postoperative ileus. Ketamine also has been shown to be effective for preemptive analgesia and in minimizing opioid-induced hyperalgesia. It has anti-kinin and anti-inflammatory properties, as it decreases TNF levels. It affords CNS protection by increasing cerebral blood flow and via its NMDA receptor blockade, which protects patients from glutamate-induced brain injury. Ketamine in low doses also appears to have minimal effect on cognitive function.

AB  - Objectives: This study was conducted to explore the course of trauma related psychological symptoms and psychiatric diagnosis in 167 children after witnessing a death at school and to assess the long term effects of their symptoms on quality of life and parents' rearing stress. Methods: 167 children were evaluated using diverse self-rating symptom scales at 2 days (T1), 2 months (T2), 6 months (T3) and 30 months (T4) after accident. All the children were interviewed with Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-IV (DISC-IV) at T1. High risk children were assessed by DISC-IV at T3 and T4. Children's quality of life and parental stress were assessed using the Parent Stress Index and Children's Health and Illness Profile at T4. Results: The mean score and prevalence of severe PTSD, anxiety symptoms decreased significantly over time but not depressive symptoms. The prevalence rate of diverse anxiety disorders decreased significantly over time. Linear and logistic regression analysis showed depressive symptoms at T3 predicted more severe parental stress (b = 0.51, OR =2.88), less satisfaction (b = -0.30, OR = 2.66) and lower achievement (b = -0.41, OR = 1.5). PTSD or anxiety symptoms were not associated with the parental stress or quality of life at T4. Conclusions: This study has provided new evidence regarding long term course of trauma related symptom and diagnosis changes in children exposed to single trauma. The result demonstrated depressive symptom impacted negatively on children's quality of life and parental stress. Careful assessment and management of depressive symptoms may have the potential to reduce parental stress and improve quality of life.

AB  - Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent group of psychiatric diseases, and have high personal and societal costs. The search for novel pharmacological treatments for these conditions is driven by the growing medical need to improve on the effectiveness and the side effect profile of existing drugs. A huge volume of data has been generated by anxiolytic drug discovery studies, which has led to the progression of numerous new molecules into clinical trials. However, the clinical outcome of these efforts has been disappointing, as promising results with novel agents in rodent studies have very rarely translated into effectiveness in humans. Here, we analyse the major trends from preclinical studies over the past 50 years conducted in the search for new drugs beyond those that target the prototypical anxiety-associated GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid)-benzodiazepine system, which have focused most intensively on the serotonin, neuropeptide, glutamate and endocannabinoid systems. We highlight various key issues that may have hampered progress in the field, and offer recommendations for how anxiolytic drug discovery can be more effective in the future. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - Results for 160 samples of disaster victims were coded as to sample type, disaster type, disaster location, outcomes and risk factors observed, and overall severity of impairment. In order of frequency, outcomes included specific psychological problems, nonspecific distress, health problems, chronic problems in living, resource loss, and problems specific to youth. Regression analyses showed that samples were more likely to be impaired if they were composed of youth rather than adults, were from developing rather than developed countries, or experienced mass violence (e.g., terrorism, shooting sprees) rather than natural or technological disasters. Most samples of rescue and recovery workers showed remarkable resilience. Within adult samples, more severe exposure, female gender, middle age, ethnic minority status, secondary stressors, prior psychiatric problems, and weak or deteriorating psychosocial resources most consistently increased the likelihood of adverse outcomes. Among youth, family factors were primary. Implications of the research for clinical practice and community intervention are discussed in a companion article (Norris, Friedman, and Watson, this volume).

AB  - On the basis of the literature reviewed in Part I of this two-part series (Norris, Friedman, Watson, Byrne, Diaz, and Kaniasty, this volume), the authors recommend early intervention following disasters, especially when the disaster is associated with extreme and widespread damage to property, ongoing financial problems for the stricken community, violence that resulted from human intent, and a high prevalence of trauma in the form of injuries, threat to life, and loss of life. Meeting the mental health needs of children, women, and survivors in developing countries is particularly critical. The family context is central to understanding and meeting those needs. Because of the complexity of disasters and responses to them, interagency cooperation and coordination are extremely important elements of the mental health response. Altogether, the research demands that we think ecologically and design and test societal- and community-level interventions for the population at large and conserve scarce clinical resources for those most in need.

AB  - In an attempt to capture the variety of symptoms that emerge following traumatic stress, the revision of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) criteria in the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) has expanded to include additional symptom presentations. One consequence of this expansion is that it increases the amorphous nature of the classification. Using a binomial equation to elucidate possible symptom combinations, we demonstrate that the DSM-IV criteria listed for PTSD have a high level of symptom profile heterogeneity (79,794 combinations); the changes result in an eightfold expansion in the DSM-5, to 636,120 combinations. In this article, we use the example of PTSD to discuss the limitations of DSM-based diagnostic entities for classification in research by elucidating inherent flaws that are either specific artifacts from the history of the DSM or intrinsic to the underlying logic of the DSM's method of classification. We discuss new directions in research that can provide better information regarding both clinical and nonclinical behavioral heterogeneity in response to potentially traumatic and common stressful life events. These empirical alternatives to an a priori classification system hold promise for answering questions about why diversity occurs in response to stressors. © The Author(s) 2013.

AB  - Does terrorism have a unique and significant emotional and behavioral impact among adults and children? In what way does the impact of terrorism exceed the individual level and affect communities and specific professional groups as well as test different leadership styles? How were professional communities of mental health clinicians, policy makers and researchers mobilized to respond to the emerging needs post-disaster? What are the lessons learned from the work conducted after 9/11 and the implications for future disaster mental health work and preparedness efforts? Yuval Neria and his team are uniquely placed to answer these questions having been involved in modifying ongoing trials and setting up new ones in New York to address these issues straight after the attacks.

AB  - This study attempted to trace the long-term psychiatric sequelae of combat in a large representative sample of combat stress reaction (CSR) Israeli casualties and matched controls. Employing DSM-III criteria for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) subjects were assessed 1, 2, and 3 years after their participation in the war. Results show that CSR casualties had dramatically higher rates of PTSD than controls at all three points of time. In both groups a decline in prevalence and breadth of PTSD was observed over time. The passage of time had a differential effect on the symptom profile of the CSR casualties and controls. Theoretical, methodological, and treatment implications are discussed. © 1989 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

AB  - Objective: We explored the course of trauma-related psychological symptoms and psychiatric diagnoses in 167 children who, as fourth graders, witnessed death at school and assessed the long-term effects of their symptoms on quality of life and their parents' rearing stress. Method: 167 children were evaluated using diverse self-rating symptom scales at 2 days (T1: May 19, 2007), 2 months (T2: July 16, 2007), 6 months (T3: November 12 - 17, 2007), and 30 months (T4: November 16 - 21, 2009) after the accident. All children were interviewed with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-Version IV (DISC-IV) at T1. High-risk children were assessed with the DISC-IV at T3 and T4. Children's quality of life and parental stress were assessed in all children and parents using the Parenting Stress Index and the Child Health and Illness Profile at T4. Results: The mean scores and prevalence of severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety symptoms decreased significantly over time (P < .001), but depressive symptoms did not. Although the prevalence of DISC-IV-based diverse anxiety disorders decreased significantly over time, 45% of high-risk subjects evaluated with the DISC-IV met criteria for an anxiety or depressive disorder at T4. Linear and logistic regression analyses showed that depressive symptoms at 6 months predicted more severe parental stress (β = 0.51; odds ratio [OR] = 2.88), less satisfaction (β = -0.25; OR = 2.66), and lower achievement (β = -0.41; OR = 1.50) at 30 months. PTSD symptoms were not associated with parental stress or quality of life at T4. Conclusions: This study provides new evidence regarding the long-term course of trauma-related symptoms and diagnostic changes in children exposed to a single trauma. Children's depressive symptoms predicted lower children's quality of life and higher parental rearing stress after 2 years. Careful assessment and management of depressive symptoms can potentially reduce parental stress and improve quality of life of children. © Copyright 2012 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB  - Objective: The authors took advantage of a 50-year prospective study of World War II veterans to examine the predictors and correlates of combat exposure, symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and trait neuroticism. Method: The subjects were 107 veterans who had been extensively studied before and immediately after serving overseas in World War II. All served as members of the study until the present time, and 91 completed questionnaires of both PTSD symptoms and neuroticism. Results: In this study group, variables associated with positive psychosocial health in adolescence and at age 65 predicted combat exposure. Combat exposure and number of physiological symptoms during combat stress-but not during civilian stress- predicted symptoms of PTSD in 1946 and 1988. Combat exposure also predicted early death and study attrition. Psychosocial vulnerability in adolescence and at age 65 and physiological symptoms during civilian stress-but not during combat stress-predicted trait neuroticism at age 65. Conclusions: Combat exposure predicted symptoms of PTSD but not nonspecific measures of psychopathology. Premorbid vulnerability predicted subsequent psychopathology but not symptoms of PTSD.

AB  - Seventy-three percent of a sample of 46 Cambodian youth interviewed in 1984 and 1987 were reinterviewed in 1990 as part of a pretest for a multisite study of Cambodian refugee trauma now under way. An additional sample of convenience of 38 youth were also interviewed to determine reliability and validity of the diagnostic instruments chosen for the larger study. The DSM-III-R diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was found to persist, but the symptoms appeared less intense over time. In contrast, the prevalence of depression dropped markedly since 1987. Subjects remained largely free of comorbid conditions. Diagnostic reliability and validity were satisfactory. The follow-up sample appeared to be functioning well despite their PTSD profiles. The findings are discussed in light of several current controversies surrounding the concept and measurement of PTSD.

AB  - Objectives: The aims of this study were to examine the symptoms of posttraumatic stress and anxiety/depression in Korean children after direct or indirect exposure to a single incident of trauma during a fire-escape drill and to assess the incidence of psychiatric disorders in this population. Method: A total of 1,394 students who attended the elementary school at which the traumatic event took place were evaluated using self-administered questionnaires (the Child Posttraumatic Stress Disorder-Reaction Index [CPTSD-RI], State Anxiety Scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children [STAIC], and Children's Depression Inventory [CDI]), as well as structured diagnostic interviews (Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, Version-IV [DISC-IV]) at 2 days (time point 1), 2 months (time point 2), and 6 months (time point 3) after the incident. The 335 students who witnessed the accident were defined as the direct-exposure group, and the remaining students (n = 1,059) were defined as the indirect- exposure group. The study was conducted from May to November 2007. Results: At time point 1, the prevalence of severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depressive symptoms was 18.2%, 5.5%, and 3.4%, respectively. The prevalence of severe PTSD symptoms, as measured by the CPTSD-RI, was significantly higher in the direct-exposure group than in the indirectexposure group (36.6% vs 12.7%, respectively; P < .001). At time point 2, the prevalence of severe PTSD symptoms was 7.4% (14.0% in the direct- exposure group and 4.9% in the indirect-exposure group, P < .001). The mean total CPTSD-RI score was significantly higher (P < .001) in the direct-exposure group than in the indirect-exposure group. At time point 3, thirty-eight of the 58 subjects (65.5%) evaluated with the DISC-IV in the direct-exposure group had 1 or more of the 7 anxiety/depressive disorders assessed, including subthreshold diagnoses. Among the diagnoses meeting full DSM-IV criteria for each disorder, agoraphobia was the most prevalent (22.4%), followed by generalized anxiety disorder (13.8%), separation anxiety disorder (6.9%), PTSD (5.2%), and social phobia (5.2%). When the subthreshold diagnoses were considered along with the full syndrome diagnoses, separation anxiety disorder was the most common diagnosis (41.4%), followed by agoraphobia (34.5%), obsessive-compulsive disorder (22.4%), PTSD (20.7%), and social phobia (20.7%). Conclusions: The results of this study provide important evidence that various anxiety/depressive disorders, in addition to PTSD, might follow after direct or indirect exposure to trauma. Our findings highlight the importance of comprehensive screening for psychiatric problems in children exposed to trauma of any scale. © Copyright 2009 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB  - Research increasingly indicates that prototypical trajectories of resilience, recovery, delayed, and chronic distress characterize reactions to acute adversity. However, trajectory research has been limited by the practical and methodological difficulties of obtaining pre-event and longitudinal data. In two studies, we employed a novel method in which trained interviewers provided a graphical depiction of prototypical stress trajectories to participants and asked them to select the one that best described their experience. In Study 1, self-identified trajectories from 21 high-exposure survivors of the September 11th World Trade Center attacks distinguished variation in posttraumatic stress disorder and depression symptoms at 7 and 18 months, and were consistent with trajectories based on longitudinal outcomes and friend/relative ratings. In Study 2, we examined self-identified trajectories from 115 bereaved spouses at 1.5 to 3 years. Persons who identified a resilient trajectory, compared with recovery and chronic distress trajectories, had fewer interviewer-rated symptoms of grief, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder were rated as functioning more effectively by friends, reported higher life satisfaction, and had fewer somatic complaints. The present results provide initial evidence for the construct validity of a cross-sectional and less demanding method for identifying acute stress trajectories.

AB  - (from the chapter) This case study is of a patient who presented with the classic symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following a serious motor vehicle accident. This event was her sixth accident over the past 10 years. Each accident/trauma exposure was followed by successively worse PTSD sequelae and longer recovery phases than the episode before, despite counseling and multiple medication trials. Within 48 hours of the sixth accident, the patient was begun on the beta adrenoceptor blocker propranolol, 60 mg twice daily. She experienced a marked and unprecedented improvement of her PTSD symptoms. Before beginning propranolol, her score on the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale was 86, indicative of severe PTSD. Eleven days following propranolol treatment, the severity was reduced to 56, below the scales' diagnostic threshold for PTSD. Propranolol discontinuation at 2 months was followed by a relapse of PTSD symptoms, but discontinuation again at 3 months was followed by continued improvement in her symptoms. This case suggests that propranolol may be an effective preventive measure in the early stages of PTSD. The etiology of PTSD is compared to the medical disease model. The role of the beta-adrenergic system in the consolidation of traumatic memories and the effects of beta adrenergic blockade are discussed in an historical context.

AB  - This study examined the effects of vicarious exposure to the September 11 terrorist attacks in an academic community, just after the three-month period that delineates acute from chronic posttraumatic stress. An entire academic community of 1693 students, faculty, and staff was surveyed electronically regarding their perceived stress symptoms and coping behaviors. The survey yielded a 37 percent response rate. About 76 percent showed one or more substantial symptoms of stress, and 32 percent showed three or more. The most prominent symptom clusters involved persistent avoidance and persistent arousal. Respondents primarily relied on coping through optimism, reassessing priorities and relationships, giving and receiving support, and becoming better informed on terrorism-related topics. Differences in symptoms and coping preferences were found based on sex, group (student, faculty, staff), and exposure to previous crisis. This study indicates that despite time and distance from the site of the terrorism, all segments of a college community continue to experience some degree of distress. Such distress can interfere with academic performance, personal health, and relationship stability. Rather than rely on formal support service delivery, most appear to rely on established interpersonal relationships. This suggests that providing support to vicarious victims in the future might emphasize training for friends and family, rather than relying on established service delivery systems.

AB  - Background:The main aims of the study were to assess psychological morbidity among adults nine months after a car bomb explosion in the town of Omagh, Northern Ireland and to identify predictors of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.Method:A questionnaire was sent to all adults in households in The Omagh District Council area. The questionnaire comprised established predictors of PTSD (such as pre-trauma personal characteristics, type of exposure, initial emotional response and long-term adverse physical or financial problems), predictors derived from the Ehlers and Clark (2000) cognitive model, a measure of PTSD symptoms and the General Health Questionnaire.Results:Among respondents (n = 3131) the highest rates of PTSD symptoms and probable casesness (58.5%) were observed among people who were present in the street when the bomb exploded but elevated rates were also observed in people who subsequently attended the scene (21.8% probable caseness) and among people for whom someone close died (11.9%). People with a near miss (left the scene before the explosion) did not show elevated rates. Exposure to the bombing increased PTSD symptoms to a greater extent than general psychiatric symptoms. Previously established predictors accounted for 42% of the variance in PTSD symptoms among people directly exposed to the bombing. Predictors derived from the cognitive model accounted for 63%.Conclusions:High rates of chronic PTSD were observed in individuals exposed to the bombing. Psychological variables that are in principle amenable to treatment were the best predictors of PTSD symptoms. Teams planning treatment interventions for victims of future bombings and other traumas may wish to take these results into account. © 2013 Duffy et al.

Delayed onset was common, as was a failure to fully remit: 78% of the 239 veterans with full or partial lifetime PTSD were symptomatic in the 3 months prior to assessment. Cluster analysis identified 4 subtypes of posttraumatic response, with women most likely to be in a delayed onset cluster, and minority men most likely to be in a severe chronic cluster. The extent of chronicity observed in this sample underscores the need for treatments that address the persistence of posttraumatic symptoms.

AB  - Sleep disturbance is a common and disturbing symptom in military personnel, with many individuals progressing to the development of insomnia, which is characterized by increased arousals, wakefulness after sleep onset, and distorted sleep architecture. The molecular mechanisms underlying insomnia remain elusive, limiting future therapeutic development to address this critical issue. We examined whole gene expression profiles associated with insomnia. We compared subjects with insomnia (n = 25) to controls (n = 13) without insomnia using microarray gene expression profiles obtained from peripheral samples of whole blood obtained from military personnel. Compared to controls, participants with insomnia had differential expression of 44 transcripts from 43 identified genes. Among the identified genes, urotensin 2 was downregulated by more than 6 times in insomnia participants, and the fold-change remained significant after controlling for depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and medication use. Urotensin 2 is involved in regulation of orexin A and B activity and rapid eye movement during sleep. These findings suggest that differential expression of these sleep-regulating genes contributes to symptoms of insomnia and, specifically, that switching between rapid eye movement and nonrapid eye movement sleep stages underlies insomnia symptoms. Future work to identify therapeutic agents that are able to regulate these pathways may provide novel treatments for insomnia. © The Author(s) 2015.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of topiramate in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Method: We conducted a 12-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study comparing topiramate to placebo. Men and women aged 18-62 years with diagnosis of PTSD according to DSM-IV were recruited from the outpatient clinic of the violence program of Federal University of São Paulo Hospital (Prove-UNIFESP), São Paulo City, between April 2006 and December 2009. Subjects were assessed for the Clinician-Administered Posttraumatic Stress Scale (CAPS), Clinical Global Impression, and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). After 1-week period of washout, 35 patients were randomized to either group. The primary outcome measure was the CAPS total score changes from baseline to the endpoint. Results: 82.35% of patients in the topiramate group exhibited improvements in PTSD symptoms. The efficacy analysis demonstrated that patients in the topiramate group exhibited significant improvements in reexperiencing symptoms: flashbacks, intrusive memories, and nightmares of the trauma (CAPS-B; P= 0.04) and in avoidance/numbing symptoms associated with the trauma, social isolation, and emotional numbing (CAPS-C; P= 0.0001). Furthermore, the experimental group demonstrated a significant difference in decrease in CAPS total score (topiramate -57.78; placebo -32.41; P= 0.0076). Mean topiramate dose was 102.94 mg/d. Topiramate was generally well tolerated. Conclusion: Topiramate was effective in improving reexperiencing and avoidance/numbing symptom clusters in patients with PTSD. This study supports the use of anticonvulsants for the improvement of symptoms of PTSD. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Many who have served in a war zone carry deep emotional wounds that go beyond the typical symptom clusters of reexperiencing, avoidance/numbing, and hyperarousal that comprise a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Specifically, many combatants experience unresolved grief, guilt, and shame caused by losses and traumatic experiences suffered in war, called "moral injury" by some clinicians and researchers (e.g., Litz et al., 2009; Shay, 1994). We describe the aspects of human attachment that set the stage for grief, guilt, and shame, and outline the 3-phase group therapy model we have implemented in a clinical setting to foster the reconnection of severed human bonds. Special attention is paid to killing and related phenomena that are unique to combat PTSD. The program phases include psychoeducation, trauma-focused therapy, and aftercare, which focuses on assisting the veterans in reconnecting with their families and communities. The use of letter writing as an intervention is illustrated through case examples, and clinical outcomes are anecdotally described. (PsycINFO Database Record © 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

AB  - The research literature has suggested that longitudinal changes in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) could be adequately described in terms of one universal trajectory, with individual differences in baseline levels (intercept) and rate of change (slope) being negligible. However, not everyone who has experienced a trauma is diagnosed with PTSD, and symptom severity levels differ between individuals exposed to similar traumas. The current study employed the latent growth mixture modeling technique to test for multiple trajectories using data from a sample of Danish rape victims (N = 255). In addition, the analysis aimed to determine whether a number of explanatory variables could differentiate between the trajectories (age, acute stress disorder [ASD], and perceived social support). Results concluded the existence of two PTSD trajectories. ASD was found to be the only significant predictor of one trajectory characterized by high initial levels of PTSD symptomatology. The present findings confirmed the existence of multiple trajectories with regard to PTSD symptomatology in a way that may be useful to clinicians working with this population. © The Author(s) 2012.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Meta-analytic evidence based on cross-sectional investigations between posttraumatic growth (PTG) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) demonstrates that the two concepts are positively related and that ethnic minorities report greater PTG. Few longitudinal studies have quantified this relationship so the evidence is limited regarding the potential benefit PTG may have on post-traumatic adjustment and whether differences between ethnic groups exist. METHODS: The current study attempts to fill a substantial gap in the literature by exploring the relationship between PTG and PTSD symptom clusters longitudinally using a nationally representative cohort of 1613 Israelis and Palestinian Citizens of Israel (PCI) interviewed via telephone on three measurement occasions during one year. Latent cross-lagged structural models estimated the relationship between PTG and each PTSD symptom cluster, derived from confirmatory factor analysis, representing latent and statistically invariant PTSD symptom factors, best representing PTSD for both ethnic groups. RESULTS: PTG was not associated with less PTSD symptom severity in any of the four PTSD clusters, for Jews and PCI. In contrast, PTSD symptom severity assessed earlier was related to later reported PTG in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that PTSD symptoms contribute to greater reported PTG, but that PTG does not provide a salutatory benefit by reducing symptoms of PTSD.

AB  - This study focused on better understanding the association between anxiety sensitivity (AS), distress tolerance (DT), and psychopathology, including posttraumatic stress, depression, panic and suicidality, in the aftermath of a potentially traumatizing event. A community-based sample of 151 adults exposed to the Mount Carmel Forest Fire Disaster were assessed within 30-days of exposure (T1) and then at 3- (T2) and 6-month (T3) follow-up intervals. At T1, AS, DT, and psychopathology symptoms loaded on a single common latent factor reflecting Emotional Avoidance and Distress; whereas by T2 AS-DT and psychopathology symptoms diverged into distinct latent variables—Emotional Distress Intolerance and Distress Post-Trauma, respectively. Levels of Emotional Distress and Avoidance at T1 predicted levels of Emotional Distress Intolerance as well as Distress Post-Trauma at T2. Finally, levels of Emotional Intolerance at T2 predicted levels of Distress Post-Trauma at T3 above and beyond the strong stability effects of Distress Post-Trauma over time. Findings are discussed with respect to their theoretical and clinical implications for understanding and promoting resilience to, and recovery following, exposure to potentially traumatic events. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to investigate (a) "secondary" posttraumatic growth (PTG) in wives of former prisoners of war (ex-POWs) and its association to husbands' captivity, husbands' posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and husbands' PTSD trajectories; and (b) the bidirectional relationships over time between wives' posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and PTG. METHOD: The study compared 116 wives of Israeli ex-POWs from the 1973 Yom Kippur War with 56 wives of a matched control group of non-POW combat veterans. Wives were divided into groups according to husbands' captivity status, husbands' PTSD status, and husbands' PTSD trajectories; and ANOVAs and MANOVAs were conducted to assess group differences in PTSS and PTG, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Autoregressive cross-lag modeling was also used to assess bidirectional relationships between wives' PTSS and PTG over time. RESULTS: Wives of ex-POWs with PTSD reported significantly higher PTG compared with wives of ex-POWs without PTSD and wives of controls. While PTG and PTSS remained stable over time, importantly, the Time 1 (T1) level of PTG predicted avoidance symptoms at Time 2 (T2); the higher the wives' PTG at T1, the higher their avoidance symptoms at T2, but not vice versa. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the notion that "secondary PTG" exists. They also strengthen the theory that growth and distress can co-occur. Finally, the finding that PTG predicted subsequent avoidance symptoms suggests that PTG does not prevent the future development of distress.

AB  - Background: Childhood physical abuse (CPA) is an international phenomenon. Rapid social changes in Chinese societies over the recent decades have raised public concern and research into CPA. The relationship between CPA and psychiatric conditions is well established in western countries. However, the questions of whether this link exists in the Chinese context and, if exists, how strong the association is remain uncertain. Objectives: To examine the impact of CPA on mental health in the Chinese context, we performed a meta-analytic review of relevant studies published up to April 2013. Methods: Literature search strategies included a comprehensive online search of three English databases and one Chinese database. Studies were included if all participants were Chinese; the study used an observational design to study the link between CPA and mental health; participantsnull mental well-being was assessed with objective measures and/or diagnostic interviews. We extracted data on publication details and methodological characteristics including the participantsnull mental health outcomes and then conducted a meta-analytic examination of the data. Results: Total 24 effect size measures from 22 studies were included in this review. All studies were retrospective: 5 studies on antisocial personality disorder (APD; 4 on its tendency and 1 on its diagnosis), 5 on borderline personality disorder (BPD; 4 on its tendency and 1 on its diagnosis), 6 on depression (5 on its symptom and 1 on its diagnosis), 2 on anxious symptoms, 2 on cluster-B personality disorders, 2 on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 1 on conduct disorder (CD) and 1 on obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Our results revealed significant association between CPA and mental health (OR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.87-2.49). According to Cohennulls calculations, this corresponds to a small-to-medium effect. Specifically, CPA in the Chinese context was associated with APD, BPD, cluster-B personality disorders, conduct disorder, depression, anxious symptoms, and PTSD. Methodological factors and sample characteristics appear to affect the findings of the included studies. We found stronger CPA-mental health association in studies with high-risk sample (criminals) than those with low-risk sample (students). Moreover, the statistical significance of the association appears to partly depend on the use of standardized assessment tool. Conclusions: This meta-analytic review is the first to examine the impact of CPA on Chinese mental health. Our findings replicate the western evidence that childhood abuse in the form of severe physical discipline can contribute to later adverse mental health and highlight the need for more effective policies and interventions to address the hidden costs of CPA for Chinese societies.

AB  - High-quality research in clinical psychology often depends on recruiting adequate samples of clinical participants with formally diagnosed difficulties. This challenge is readily met within the context of a large treatment center, but many clinical researchers work in academic settings that do not feature a medical school, hospital connections, or an in-house clinic. This article describes the model we developed at the University of Waterloo Centre for Mental Health Research for identifying and recruiting large samples of people from local communities with diagnosable mental health problems who are willing to participate in research but for whom treatment services are not offered. We compare the diagnostic composition, symptom profile, and demographic characteristics of our participants with treatment-seeking samples recruited from large Canadian and American treatment centers. We conclude that the Anxiety Studies Division model represents a viable and valuable method for recruiting clinical participants from the community for psychopathology research.

AB  - Current thinking on what constitutes torture in a detention/interrogation setting focuses solely on particular procedures, without regard for contextual factors that mediate traumatic stress. The present study examined stressor interactions that determined severity and psychological impact of captivity stressors in 432 torture survivors in former Yugoslavia countries and Turkey. A principal components analysis of 46 captivity stressors measured by an Exposure to Torture Scale identified meaningful stressor clusters, which suggested that multiple detention procedures were used in combination to maximize their impact. Perceived torture severity related to 'cruel, inhuman, and degrading' treatments (CIDT) but not to physical torture. Posttraumatic stress disorder related to war-related captivity, deprivation of basic needs, sexual torture, and exposure to extreme temperatures, isolation, and forced stress positions but not to physical torture. CIDT increased posttraumatic stress disorder risk by 71%. Fear- and helplessness-inducing effects of captivity and CIDT appear to be the major determinants of perceived severity of torture and psychological damage in detainees. Considerations on what constitutes torture need to take into account the contextual processes in a captivity setting that mediate these effects. © 2009 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Recent research has begun to identify the neurocognitive and psychological effects of childhood maltreatment, although information is limited on the neuropsychological presentation of maltreatment in psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents. This study examined the executive-functioning and language abilities as well as psychopathological presentation of childhood maltreatment victims in an adolescent psychiatric inpatient setting. The sample consisted of adolescent inpatients (ages 13-19 years old) who completed a neuropsychological/psychological assessment during hospitalization (n = 122). The sample was grouped based on childhood maltreatment history, with one group categorized by maltreatment history (n = 49) and the other group characterized by no maltreatment history (n = 73). Analyses revealed statistically significant differences (p <.01) between maltreatment groups on executive functioning, as well as on measures of self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms. No group differences remained after controlling for posttraumatic stress disorder. Further, distinct neuropsychological profiles were identified for specific types of maltreatment experienced. These findings suggest that while childhood maltreatment is associated with a range of neuropsychological impairments, the specific type of maltreatment experienced may have a significant influence on the type and severity of impairments. These findings contribute to the growing body of research on the significant consequences of childhood maltreatment. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop an effective measure of resilience at work for use in individual work-related performance and emotional distress contexts. METHODS: Two separate cross-sectional studies investigated: (1) exploratory factor analysis of 45 items putatively underpinning workplace resilience among 397 participants and (2) confirmatory factor analysis of resilience measure derived from Study 1 demonstrating a credible model of interaction, with performance outcome variables among 194 participants. RESULTS: A 20-item scale explaining 67% of variance, measuring seven aspects of workplace resilience, which are teachable and capable of conscious development, was achieved. A credible model of relationships with work engagement, sleep, stress recovery, and physical health was demonstrated in the expected directions. CONCLUSION: The new scale shows considerable promise as a reliable instrument for use in the area of employee support and development.

AB  - The purpose of this study was that of defining psychiatric profiles among veterans based on a structured interview of 3,595 individuals administered by outreach mental health clinicians to individuals who were presently or recently homeless. The interview included ratings of presence or absence of current psychiatric disorders; alcoholism, drug abuse, psychosis, mood disorders, personality disorders, PTSD, and adjustment disorders. We identified three subgroups using cluster analysis each showing different diagnostic profiles that were characterized as "addiction" (n = 3,061), "psychosis" (n = 218), and "personality" disorders (n = 54). Cluster membership was related to demographic characteristics, living situation, length of homelessness, and symptoms and complaints including cognitive difficulties, suicidality, violence, and depression. Group comparison statistics were used to compare intercluster differences in demographics, homeless situation, symptoms, and subjective complaints. There were no major intercluster differences in socioethnic, demographic, and homeless situation variables. Differences occurred in complaints of depression, positive symptoms of psychosis, and suicidality. It was concluded that despite the disproportionate sizes of the clusters homeless veterans with mental illness are nevertheless heterogeneous with regard to their psychiatric profiles. © 2008 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has a primary etiology in experiencing psychological trauma and the subsequent psychological sequelae (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). There are multiple trauma types that may serve as the index trauma in PTSD. This exploratory study compared DSM-5 PTSD symptoms for 3 types of trauma in veterans: combat trauma (n = 36), sexual trauma (n = 21), and civilian trauma (n = 21). Results indicated that veterans with combat trauma were likely to experience diminished interest and detachment and estrangement from others. Veterans with sexual trauma were likely to experience detachment and estrangement from others, sleep disturbances, and problems with concentration. Veterans with civilian traumas were less likely to meet criteria for PTSD and were less likely to experience a number of PTSD symptoms. Results of this preliminary study suggest that PTSD is not a unitary disorder, but a disorder characterized by different subtypes based on the precipitating trauma.

AB  - Studies identifying a high prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and low treatment utilization among Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) Veterans reinforce the need for a greater understanding of the disorder in this population. Although traditional masculine norms have been found to relate to both help seeking and PTSD among civilians, little is known about their impact on war Veterans. The current study examined relationships between masculine behaviors, using the Masculine Behavior Scale (MBS), and PTSD symptoms in OEF/OIF Veterans, drawing on archival clinical data from 69 patients at an outpatient PTSD clinic. Despite a positive trend, total MBS scores were not correlated with overall PTSD severity. However, the MBS subscale Exaggerated Self-Reliance and Control positively predicted hyperarousal symptoms in a hierarchical regression model. Unexpectedly, the MBS subscale Success Dedication negatively predicted avoidance, suggesting that this masculine norm may serve a protective function against avoidance symptoms. Results suggest that elements of masculinity are related to specific PTSD symptom clusters in ways that may be both adaptive and maladaptive. Implications for PTSD treatment are discussed. © 2011 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Previous research has suggested that both exposure to potentially traumatic events (PTEs) and emotional reactions to such events act as risk factors for subsequent exposure. Although some studies have implicated posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms as risk factors, extant research suffers from a number of methodological limitations, including the use of cross-sectional designs and student populations. The present study sought to address these limitations using a 2-year, 3-wave national probability household sample of 2,863 adult women. After controlling for demographic characteristics, prior exposure to PTEs, and Wave 1 depression and substance abuse, PTSD reexperiencing symptoms at Wave 1 predicted subsequent exposure to interpersonal violence victimization (IPVV) perpetrated by a nonintimate perpetrator; however, PTSD symptoms did not predict intimate partner IPVV. In addition, PTSD hyperarousal symptoms were unique predictors of subsequent exposure to other traumatic stressors. Findings suggest that efforts to prevent PTEs should focus attention on both prior exposure and PTSD symptoms in response to such exposure. © 2009 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with regional alterations in brain structure and function that are hypothesized to contribute to symptoms and cognitive deficits associated with the disorder. We present here the first systematic meta-analysis of neurocognitive outcomes associated with PTSD to examine a broad range of cognitive domains and describe the profile of cognitive deficits, as well as modifying clinical factors and study characteristics. This report is based on data from 60 studies totaling 4,108 participants, including 1,779 with PTSD, 1,446 trauma-exposed comparison participants, and 895 healthy comparison participants without trauma exposure. Effect-size estimates were calculated using a mixed-effects meta-analysis for 9 cognitive domains: attention/working memory, executive functions, verbal learning, verbal memory, visual learning, visual memory, language, speed of information processing, and visuospatial abilities. Analyses revealed significant neurocognitive effects associated with PTSD, although these ranged widely in magnitude, with the largest effect sizes in verbal learning (d = -.62), speed of information processing (d = -.59), attention/working memory (d = -.50), and verbal memory (d =-.46). Effect-size estimates were significantly larger in treatment-seeking than community samples and in studies that did not exclude participants with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and effect sizes were affected by between-group IQ discrepancies and the gender composition of the PTSD groups. Our findings indicate that consideration of neuropsychological functioning in attention, verbal memory, and speed of information processing may have important implications for the effective clinical management of persons with PTSD. Results are further discussed in the context of cognitive models of PTSD and the limitations of this literature. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

AB  - Patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may fail to achieve adequate relief despite treatment with psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or complementary medicine treatments. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation procedure that can alter neuronal activity through administration of various pulse sequences and frequencies. TMS may theoretically have promise in correcting alterations observed in patients with PTSD. While the precise treatment location and pulse sequences remain undefined, current evidence suggests two promising targets, the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex. The beneficial effects may be due to the secondary or indirect regulation of other brain structures that may be involved in the mood regulatory network. TMS may be an effective part of a comprehensive treatment program for PTSD, although significant work remains to define optimal treatment parameters and clarify how it fits within a broader traditional treatment program.

Applications to psychometric scale data, offense counts, and a dichotomous prevalence measure in violence research are illustrated. In addition, the use of the Bayesian information criterion to address the problem of model selection, including the estimation of the number of components in the mixture, is demonstrated.

They also responded to a set of questions in order to determine the direction (upward-downward) of their counterfactual thoughts. The observed data were subjected to a multivariate analysis of variance and multiple discriminant analysis to identify the key underlying dimensions. The main effects of amnesia, depersonalization, percentage of dissociation, and family type were highly significant. Discriminant coefficients suggested the importance of relating to others and proactive coping. They also suggested the importance of intrusion, avoidance, and appreciation of life. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Objective: We conducted a systematic review of the literature to explore the longitudinal course of PTSD in DSM-5-defined trauma exposed populations to identify the course of illness and recovery for individuals and populations experiencing PTSD. Methods: We reviewed the published literature from January 1, 1998 to December 31, 2010 for longitudinal studies of directly exposed trauma populations in order to: (1) review rates of PTSD in the first year after a traumatic event; (2) examine potential types of proposed DSM-5 direct trauma exposure (intentional and non-intentional); and (3) identify the clinical course of PTSD (early onset, later onset, chronicity, remission, and resilience). Of the 2537 identified articles, 58 articles representing 35 unique subject populations met the proposed DSM-5 criteria for experiencing a traumatic event, and assessed PTSD at two or more time points within 12 months of the traumatic event. Results: The mean prevalence of PTSD across all studies decreases from 28.8% (range = 3.1-87.5%) at 1 month to 17.0% (range = 0.6-43.8%) at 12 months. However, when traumatic events are classified into intentional and non-intentional, the median prevalences trend down for the non-intentional trauma exposed populations, while the median prevalences in the intentional trauma category steadily increase from 11.8% to 23.3%. Across five studies with sufficient data, 37.1% of those exposed to intentional trauma develop PTSD. Among those with PTSD, about one third (34.8%) remit after 3 months. Nearly 40% of those with PTSD (39.1%) have a chronic course, and only a very small fraction (3.5%) of new PTSD cases appears after three months. Conclusions: Understanding the trajectories of PTSD over time, and how it may vary by type of traumatic event (intentional vs. non-intentional) will assist public health planning and treatment.

AB  - Prior reports suggest an ambivalence regarding treatment in individuals with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). A model that accommodates such ambivalence is the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (TTM, also known as the Stages-of-Change Model). Fifty veterans presenting for treatment completed self-report measures (94% response rate) that assessed disorder variables and constructs relating to the TTM. While the relationships between the components of each specific construct were found to be consistent with the findings of other studies and a number of predicted relationships between variables were confirmed, many results were inconsistent with the TTM. Notwithstanding questions about the suitability of the self-report measures, the unique characteristics of the veteran sample and the small sample size, the results suggest that the assumptions of the TTM were not met in veterans with PTSD.

AB  - In Nepal, spirit possession is a common phenomenon occurring both in individuals and in groups. To identify the cultural contexts and psychosocial correlates of spirit possession, we conducted a mixed-method study in a village in central Nepal experiencing a cluster of spirit possession events. The study was carried out in three stages: (1) a pilot study consisting of informal interviews with possessed individuals, observations of the possession spells, and video recording of possession events; (2) a case–control study comparing the prevalence of symptoms of common mental disorders in women who had and had not experienced possession; and (3) a follow-up study with focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with possessed and non-possessed men and women, and key informants. Quantitative results indicated that possessed women reported higher rates of traumatic events and higher levels of symptoms of mental disorder compared to non-possessed women (Anxiety 68 vs. 18 %, Depression 41 vs. 19 %, and PTSD 27 vs. 0 %). However, qualitative interviews with possessed individuals, family members, and traditional healers indicated that they did not associate possession states with mental illness. Spirit possession was viewed as an affliction that provided a unique mode of communication between humans and spirits. As such, it functioned as an idiom of distress that allowed individuals to express suffering related to mental illness, socio-political violence, traumatic events, and the oppression of women. The study results clearly indicate that spirit possession is a multi-dimensional phenomenon that cannot be mapped onto any single psychiatric or psychological diagnostic category or construct. Clinical and public health efforts to address spirit possession must take the socio-cultural context and systemic dynamics into account to avoid creating iatrogenic illness, undermining coping strategies, and exacerbating underlying social problems.

AB  - The present study explored the targeting of a preventative information provision intervention delivered to children following accidental injury by assessing the impact of initial traumatic distress on response to treatment. Analyses were based on baseline and 6-month outcome of child traumatic stress in a control (n = 28) and an intervention group (n = 31). Moderation of treatment outcome by initial levels of child traumatic stress was assessed through multiple hierarchical regression analyses. Results indicated the interaction between treatment provision and initial level of posttraumatic stress significantly predicted 6-month outcome (β = -.42, p = .019). When initial distress was high, children in the control group demonstrated an increase in trauma symptoms, and had significantly higher trauma symptoms at follow-up than those in the treatment group (d = 0.94, p = .008). When initial distress was not elevated, no significant differences were noted between the groups. These results indicate that a preventative early intervention may be best targeted at children presenting with the specific risk factor of high initial distress. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company.

AB  - Given the extent of the mental health problem following earthquakes, brief, effective and cost-effective treatment interventions are needed. This study examined whether cognitive-behavioural treatment could be shortened to a minimum number of sessions without undermining its effectiveness in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study participants (N=231) were consecutive referrals to 5 project sites in the earthquake region in Turkey a mean of 13 mo after the disaster. A modified behavioural treatment (BT) was used, which involved self-exposure instructions based on an enhancement of "sense of control" rather than a habituation rationale and minimal cognitive interventions. The duration of treatment was variable, involving as many sessions as required for clinical improvement. Survival analysis explored the minimum number of sessions required for clinical improvement, and multiple regression analysis to examine the predictors of outcome. Survivors received a mean of 4.3 sessions. Significant treatment effects and clinically meaningful effect sizes were noted on all measures. Treatment improved all PTSD and depression symptoms. The cumulative proportion of improved cases was 76% after one session and 88% after two sessions. No baseline variable predicted treatment outcome.

AB  - Adolescent psychiatry is experiencing a growing need for brief yet psychometrically robust outcome measures for inpatient settings. Outcome measures currently available present limitations to clinicians and patients alike in terms of their excessive length, time of completion, difficulty to score, and focus on specific clusters of symptoms. The present study sought to validate the Brief Symptom Measure-25 (BSM-25) as a brief and easily administered measure of global psychiatric symptom severity in adolescent inpatient samples. This study evaluated the results from 154 adolescent inpatients who completed several self-report measures at admission. The findings demonstrate that the instrument has good construct validity when compared with validated measures of psychological health and well-being, behavioral problems, and interpersonal distress. We also showed the sensitivity to change of the BSM-25 from admission to discharge, and we showed that this healthy change was paralleled in several measures (self-reports and clinician ratings), using data from 75 adolescent psychiatric inpatients who were assessed at admission and also at discharge. Although this is only the first step in the validation of this measure for an adolescent inpatient setting, the BSM-25 shows promise as a brief outcome measure of global psychiatric symptom severity while maintaining validity and instrument sensitivity.

AB  - Background: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most common mental disorders; however, there is no brief clinical measure for assessing GAD. The objective of this study was to develop a brief self-report scale to identify probable cases of GAD and evaluate its reliability and validity. Methods: A criterion-standard study was performed in 15 primary care clinics in the United States from November 2004 through June 2005. Of a total of 2740 adult patients completing a study questionnaire, 965 patients had a telephone interview with a mental health professional within 1 week. For criterion and construct validity, GAD self-report scale diagnoses were compared with independent diagnoses made by mental health professionals; functional status measures; disability days; and health care use. Results: A 7-item anxiety scale (GAD-7) had good reliability, as well as criterion, construct, factorial, and procedural validity. A cut point was identified that optimized sensitivity (89%) and specificity (82%). Increasing scores on the scale were strongly associated with multiple domains of functional impairment (all 6 Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form General Health Survey scales and disability days). Although GAD and depression symptoms frequently co-occurred, factor analysis confirmed them as distinct dimensions. Moreover, GAD and depression symptoms had differing but independent effects on functional impairment and disability. There was good agreement between self-report and interviewer-administered versions of the scale. Conclusion: The GAD-7 is a valid and efficient tool for screening for GAD and assessing its severity in clinical practice and research. ©2006 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Blast-related traumatic brain injury (TBI) from the Afghanistan and Iraq wars represents a significant medical concern for troops and veterans. To better understand the consequences of primary-blast injury in humans, we present a case of a Marine exposed to multiple primary blasts during his 14-year military career. The neuropsychological profile of this formerly high-functioning veteran suggested primarily executive dysfunction. Diffusion-tensor imaging revealed white-matter pathology in long fiber tracks compared with a composite fractional-anisotropy template derived from a veteran reference control group without TBI. This study supports the existence of primary blast-induced neurotrauma in humans and introduces a neuroimaging technique with potential to discriminate multiple-blast TBI.

AB  - Discriminating neural abnormalities into the causes versus consequences of psychopathology would enhance the translation of neuroimaging findings into clinical practice. By regarding the traumatic encounter as a reference point for disease onset, neuroimaging studies of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can potentially allocate PTSD neural abnormalities to either predisposing (pre-exposure) or acquired (post-exposure) factors. Based on novel research strategies in PTSD neuroimaging, including genetic, environmental, twin, and prospective studies, we provide a causal model that accounts for neural abnormalities in PTSD, and outline its clinical implications. Current data suggest that abnormalities within the amygdala and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex represent predisposing risk factors for developing PTSD, whereas dysfunctional hippocampal-ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) interactions may become evident only after having developed the disorder.

AB  - Overt aggression in its various forms is the most prevalent symptom presenting to pediatric mental health providers, regardless of setting. It is a behavior with a heterogeneous etiology and requires a comprehensive approach to evaluation and treatment. Evaluation of the aggressive child must assess medical, neurologic, psychiatric, psychosocial, familial, and/or educational contributions to behavioral dyscontrol. Multimodal treatment is generally required. At present, there is no single medication to recommend for the treatment of aggressive behavior. Multiple medications have clinically been used in a nonspecific fashion to target excessive childhood aggression. Although successful for some, this approach increases risk for ineffective interventions accompanied by side effects. Until a scientific understanding of the developmental neurobiology of aggression leads to more specific treatment, this review suggests the use of a diagnostic-based approach to the pharmacology of aggression. Descriptive diagnostic techniques should be used to define the presence of any primary or comorbid psychiatric disorder that presents with aggression as an associated symptom. Treating aggression in the context of these psychiatric syndromes appears to be the most direct approach. Aggression occurring in the context of a medication-responsive psychiatric diagnosis appears most sensitive to pharmacologic intervention. Presently, evidence for efficacy is strongest for aggression in the context of ADHD, psychotic disorder, adolescent-onset bipolar disorder, and ictal aggression. It remains less clear that medication can help aggression when it occurs independently of a pharmacologically treatable comorbid psychiatric disorder. Aggression may respond to a target symptom approach where discrete behavioral symptoms that contribute to aggression, such as irritability, explosiveness, fear, or impulsivity, may be modified by medication intervention. When treatment is approached in this fashion, it is standard practice to use the least toxic and safest intervention first. Behavioral treatment based on contingency management principles could be initially recommended. Medication trials should first use medications that have demonstrated empiric efficacy in reducing aggression and that have a favorable safety profile. Neuroleptics to treat aggression in nonpsychotic psychiatrically referred youth should be kept to a minimum, secondary to their significant adverse risk profile. Alternative medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake-inhibiting antidepressants, buspirone, lithium, anticonvulsants, opiate blocking agents, propranolol, nadolol, and clonidine, deserve more clinical research in pediatric aggression. These medications may offer effective and less toxic alternatives in the pharmacologic treatment of inappropriate excessive childhood aggression.

AB  - Background and purpose: Studying patients with secondary movement disorders (SMD) provides a unique opportunity to determine the correlation between the etiology and phenomenology of movement disorders. Methods: This was a prospective study of 103 patients (43 women, 60 men; age=28.7±17.3years; range=2-70years) with SMD, in a tertiary hospital over 4years. Results: The mean age of onset of SMD was 24.3±19.7years, and duration of symptoms was 4.3±7.1years (42days to 40years). Patients with pure tremor, pure dystonia (DYS), or a combination of tremor with dystonia had longest latency (10.9-18.5months), whereas those with parkinsonism (PAR) and hemiballismus (HMB) had shorter latency (2.7-3.0weeks). Pure dystonia was most prevalent (30.1%) followed by dystonia plus (13.6%), tremor (12.6%), PAR (11.7%), HMB (8.7%), mixed SMD (7.8%), tremor with dystonia (6.8%), myoclonus (5.8%), and chorea (2.9%). In approximately 60% of patients, the underlying etiologies were vascular (VAS), infections, and space-occupying lesions (SOL), and 25% had SMD following trauma or hypoxia (HYP). With reference to specific etiologies, the most frequent SMDs were tremor following SOL (46%), post-traumatic syndromes (25%), dystonia following HYP (56%), VAS lesions (50%), and infections (28%). With reference to specific SMDs, the most common etiologies were VAS for dystonia (39%), SOL for tremor (67%), and PAR (31%), and both SOL and trauma (37.5% each) for tremor with dystonia. Conclusions: Our study highlights the spectrum of SMDs and the lack of correlation between types of SMDs and underlying etiologies. Preventable causes such as infections, HYP, trauma, and kernicterus still play a major role in pathogenesis of SMD. © 2011 The Author(s). European Journal of Neurology © 2011 EFNS.

The dual-diagnosis women consistently had a more severe clinical profile, including worse life conditions (e.g., physical appearance, opportunities in life), both as children and as adults; greater criminal behavior; a higher number of lifetime suicide attempts; a greater number having a sibling with a drug problem; and fewer outpatient psychiatric treatments. One discrepant finding, however, was their lower rate of major depression. Interestingly, the 2 groups did not differ in number or type of lifetime traumas, PTSD onset or severity, family history of substance use; coping style, functioning level, psychiatric symptoms, or sociodemographic characteristics. Treatment implications and methodological limitations are discussed.

This paper will collate available information on the neurobiology of PTSD for clinical and lay audiences. This paper reviews the literature surrounding typical symptoms of PTSD, with a specific focus on the neurobiological evidence suggesting altered brain functioning among those with the condition. It will also present literature reviewing common treatment methods of PTSD and their potential effects on brain functioning, including attention, working memory, and emotional regulation. The concept of post-traumatic growth will also be introduced, indicating an alternate trajectory of PTSD.

AB  - Trauma Risk Management is a peer-support program that aims to promote help-seeking in the aftermath of traumatic events. Prior to its implementation, the British military conducted a randomized controlled trial of Trauma Risk Management against standard care in 12 warships; 6 were randomized to use Trauma Risk Management after collecting baseline measurements. Follow up after 12-18 months found no significant change in psychological health or stigma scores in either group; however, the studied vessels only encountered low numbers of critical incidents. Additionally, measurements of organizational functioning were modestly better in the Trauma Risk Management ships. The authors conclude that within organizations using Trauma Risk Management may be beneficial and may, in time, lead to a valuable cultural shift.

Two common types of combat-related guilt based on this conceptualization are described and cognitive relabeling treatment strategies which have a 'type' specific focus are outlined. The needs for research on guilt assessment among trauma survivors and for interventions that focus explicitly on guilt management are discussed.

AB  - The brutal murder of James Byrd Jr. in June 1998 unleashed a storm of media, interest groups, high profile individuals and criticism on the Southeast Texas community of Jasper. The crime and subsequent response-from within the community as well as across the world-engulfed the entire town in a collective trauma. Using natural disaster literature/theory and employing an ecological approach, Jasper, Texas was investigated via an interrupted time series analysis to identify how the community changed as compared to a control community (Center, Texas) on crime, economic, health, educational, and social capital measures collected at multiple pre- and post-crime time points between 1995 and 2003. Differences-in-differences (DD) analysis revealed significant post-event changes in Jasper, as well as a surprising degree of resilience and lack of negative consequences. Interviews with residents conducted between March 2005 and 2007 identified how the community responded to the crisis and augmented quantitative findings with qualitative, field-informed interpretation. Interviews suggest the intervention of external organizations exacerbated the severity of the events. However, using strengths of specific local social institutions-including faith based, law enforcement, media, business sector and civic government organizations-the community effectively responded to the initial threat and to the potential negative ramifications of external entities.

AB  - Abstract: Purpose. -Although antidepressant drugs have been proven as an effective treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), there are few comparative studies of antidepressants that are acting on different neurotransmitters. The main aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of different class of antidepressant drugs on the PTSD. Subjects/materials and methods. - In this open label study, the patients who met DSM-IV criteria for PTSD were randomly assigned to flexible doses of fluoxetine, moclobemide, or tianeptine. After the first assessment, consecutive assessments were performed at the end of weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 using clinician administered PTSD scale (CAPS) and Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S). Changes in the total score of CAPS and sub-scale scores of symptom clusters (re-experience, avoidance, and hyperarousal) were the main output of efficacy. All statistics were based on intention-to-treat and last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) principles. Results. - Thirty-eight patients were assigned to fluoxetine, 35 patients were assigned to moclobemide, and 30 patients were assigned to tianeptine group. Gender distributions and mean ages of the treatment groups were not significantly different. Drop-out rates due to an adverse events or unknown reasons were not significantly different among fluoxetine (18.4%), moclobemide (14.3%), and tianeptine (20.0%) groups. All three treatments has led to a significant improvement in PTSD severity assessed with CAPS total score (ANOVA P < 0.001). Similarly, total scores of re-experiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal clusters that are subscales of CAPS were significantly reduced by all three treatments (with ANOVA all P values < 0.001). There was not significant difference in terms of treatment effect between three groups. Discussion. - Treatment groups showed very similar improvement on all ratings scales. The findings support that fluoxetine, moclobemide, and tianeptine are all effective in the treatment of PTSD. Different mechanisms of action for these antidepressant drugs might result in the same common neurochemical end point. However, further studies using different classes of antidepressant drugs are needed. © 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: This study tests the hypothesis that trauma histories, including histories of physical and sexual abuse, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are more prevalent in psychogenic non-epileptic seizure (NES) patients than in epilepsy patients. Methods: Thirty-five inpatients with intractable seizures were evaluated for trauma history and PTSD. After these assessments, patients were diagnosed as having either epileptic or nonepileptic seizures through EEG monitoring. Results: NES diagnosis correlated with PTSD and total number of lifetime traumas, adult traumas, and abuse traumas. Contrary to previous hypotheses, reported childhood sexual abuse (CSA) did not correlate significantly with NES diagnosis. However, CSA predicted PTSD in a discriminant analysis. Conclusions: We found evidence for the hypothesized relations between trauma, abuse, PTSD, and NES diagnosis. However, elevated levels in both seizure-disorder groups suggest that routine assessment for abuse, trauma, and PTSD might facilitate medical care and treatment for all intractable seizure patients.

AB  - The presence of a personality disorder (PD) has been associated with certain types of poor treatment outcomes in patients with substance use disorders (SUDs). The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of comorbid PDs in psychiatrically hospitalized adults with both non-SUD Axis I disorders and SUDs, and to assess the relationship between Axis II psychopathology and degree of pretreatment addiction severity and treatment outcome. Method: One hundred consecutive inpatients admitted to a mixed dual diagnosis inpatient unit were assessed using semistructured interviews for SUDs, non-SUD Axis I disorders, and PDs. Pretreatment severity was assessed using a modified version of the Addiction Severity Index (ASI). Outcome measures were assessed both during hospitalization and at an initial follow-up appointment after discharge. Statistical analyses were performed comparing dually diagnosed patients with and without Axis II psychopathology. Results: A significant number (53%) of the patients met criteria for at least one personality disorder. Of the PDs, Cluster B PDs were the most prevalent, particularly borderline personality disorder (74%) and antisocial personality disorder (66%). Dually diagnosed patients without an Axis II diagnosis had less severe pretreatment severity measures. During hospitalization, patients with Axis II disorders had higher levels of psychopathology on the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) subscales of sensitivity and hostility. However, there was no difference in overall degree of global improvement during hospitalization. During follow-up, patients with Axis II disorders were significantly less likely to be compliant in attending their initial follow-up appointment. Conclusions: Dual diagnosis inpatients with PDs appear to improve as much as patients without PDs during their inpatient hospitalizations; however, they appear to be less likely to be compliant with attending their initial follow-up appointment.

AB  - Background: Prior traumatic experiences have been associated with poorer coping strategies, greater distress, and more posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms following a subsequent cancer diagnosis affecting their survival. However, the impact of prior physical traumatic injury on cancer survival has not been examined. Methods: The present study matched patients from the same Level 1 Trauma center who appeared in both the trauma and cancer registries. A total of 498 patients met the criteria between 1998 and 2014 who have experienced both a diagnosis of cancer and a physical traumatic injury. The survival between the patients who had physical trauma before cancer (TBC) versus those that had physical trauma after the cancer diagnosis (TAC) were compared. Results: The TBC group had a higher percentage of males (48 % vs 33 % p = 0.001) and motor vehicle collisions (18 % vs 7 %, p < 0.001), than the TAC group. TBC patients were also significantly younger than TAC patients at the time of the physical traumatic event (68.7 ± 14.6 vs 76.2 ± 12.0 years, p < 0.001), and longer length of time between the cancer diagnosis and physical traumatic injury (2.9 ± 2.9 vs 1.7 ± 2.6 years, p < 0.001). The overall probability of survival for the entire sample was 68 %. Percent survival for the TBC (n = 251) and TAC (n = 247) groups was 56 and 80 % respectively (p < 0.001). Results were consistent regardless of stage of cancer at diagnosis (hazard ratio (HR (Standard Error)). After adjusting for comorbidities Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) (HR = 1.2 (0.06), p = 0.009)), cancer stage (HR = 2.8 (0.12), p < 0.001)), lung cancer (HR = 1.7 (0.25), p < 0.001) and bladder cancer (HR = 3.5 (0.55), p = 0.02), experiencing a prior physical traumatic injury was associated with an increased HR for mortality of 4.6 (0.93), p < 0.001). Conclusions: A physical traumatic episode before cancer diagnosis (TBC) increased the risk of death 4.6 fold compared to the TAC group even after adjusting for CCI, stage of cancer at diagnosis, lung cancer, and bladder cancer. These findings suggest considering a history of physical traumatic injury in cancer patients as a possible risk factor for faster cancer progression and mortality. © 2015 Delahanty et al.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is assumed to be an equivalent syndrome regardless of the type of traumatic event that precipitated it. However, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) and previous research suggest that the clinical presentation of PTSD varies by trauma type. This study compared PTSD symptom profiles in three types of civilian trauma: sexual assault (n = 86), motor vehicle accident (n = 162), and sudden loss of a loved one (n = 185). Groups differed in overall PTSD severity and displayed distinct PTSD symptom patterns. Results suggest that different trauma types lead to unique variants of the PTSD syndrome, which may result from different etiological factors and may require different treatment approaches. © 2009 International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies.

AB  - Detection and intervention in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after ICU admission is important for patient's quality of recovery. Data from the UK suggest that there is a high incidence of PTSD in ICU survivors, and an early specialist referral is required for these patients. A simple 14-point questionnaire such as PTSS-14 (which could be administered by clinicians without specialist psychological training) could be used to screen for risk of PTSD in ICU survivors. Literature is sparse on looking at the temporal profile and evolution of PTSS scores in hospital after ICU discharge and at one month at which the diagnosis of PTSD can be made. After ethics committee approval 447 survivors of ICU were prospectively enrolled from the Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, over a period from March 2010 to August 2013. Data collected included demographics, previous psychiatric history and PTSS scores. While all subjects (n=447) completed the initial questionnaire, 337 patients completed the questionnaire at one month. Mean age of this cohort was 59±16 years (279 males and 168 females). In the ward after ICU discharge there was a significant increase in the PTSS-14 scores 31±15 (mean±SD), which reduced at one month to 28±14 (p value 0.0004, paired t test, CI 1.0 to 3.5 ). There was correlation between the in-hospital and one-month PTSS-14 scores in patients (slope 0.572, R2 0.388) (Figure 1, following page). The scores correlated better in patients without a previous psychiatric history (R2 0.42 vs 0.21) and patients with an ICU length of stay (LOS) of less than five days (R2 0.49 vs 0.338). The strength of association (R2 value) declined further with increased ICU LOS. Gender and age did not influence the predictive value (males R2 0.395, females R2 0.369, <70 years R2 0.4, ≥70 years 0.4). (Table Presented) PTSS 14 can be used to screen for PTSD in ICU survivors early after ICU discharge. There is a temporal correlation between the in-hospital and the one-month PTSS scores in ICU survivors. Caution is advised in interpreting the results of patients with a previous psychiatric history and patients with an ICU LOS of five or more days. This could have a significant effect on the fraction of ICU survivors that could effectively be screened and followed up for risk of PTSD.

AB  - Few studies exist on the outcome of patients with personality disorders (PDs) treated at ordinary outpatient clinics. This study examines the gains of such patients 2 years after treatment start at an outpatient clinic. Three patient groups were sampled: cluster A + B PDs, cluster C PDs and axis I disorders. Fifty-eight patients (53%) were amenable to follow-up, and they did not show less psychopathology than the non-compliers. All patients had structured interviews and filled in questionnaires. Patients in the PDs cluster A + B group showed considerable gains, while that was not found for the PDs cluster C and Axis I disorder groups. Since almost all patients received long-term psychotherapy sometimes combined with antidepressant drugs, the finding that such a treatment mainly shows gains in more severely disturbed PDs patients should be replicated in larger samples at ordinary psychiatric outpatient clinics. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.
